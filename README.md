AliceFixturesBundle
===================

A Symfony2 bundle for flexible usage of Alice and Faker in symfony2.

## Introduction

The aim of this bundle is to provide a new way of working with data fixtures detached from the common Doctrine DataFixtures.
Loading of fixtures should be decoupled and easy to integrate where needed.
This bundle offers loading Fixtures from yaml and php files, also dropping recreating the ORM Schema.
